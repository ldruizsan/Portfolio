- The goal of this project is to visualize the trends of 4 pollutants that are part of what the EPA calls [criteria pollutants](https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants) and determine if the US has complied with the standards that have been established by the EPA.
- Python libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy.Stats
- Input: concentration levels by location for ground-level ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and carbon monoxide along the Air Quality Index (AQI) for each
- Output: Visualization of trends using lineplots and measure statistical significances

- This project evaluated performance of account executives and developed models for a new sales commission structure for the new fiscal year
- Three strategies were considered:
  - Assume the company is increasing the book of business, no increase in headcount, same compensation structure
  - Modify the compensation structure with the same target revenue (no BoB growth) and no increase in headcount
  - Increase headcount while keeping the same structure and book of business
- A fourth strategy combines the first 3 to estimate the impact
- The model showed that, individually, the first strategy provided the largest revenue growth by over $200 million. However, combining all three is expected to grow by over $400 million.
- The project also includes an employee dashboard that allows to look up performance of any single account executive and a dashboard to evaluate the performance of executives by level

- This is my submission for Maven Analytics' Toys challenge and we we tasked with providing insight into possible expansion strategies for the company
- My analysis showed the company has a lot of inventory at hand and identified three cities in Mexico that can be considered for opening new stores that are closer to high-volume areas and can also help distribute excess inventory
