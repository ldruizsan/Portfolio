- Python libraries used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy.Stats
- Input: concentration levels by location for ground-level ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and carbon monoxide along the Air Quality Index (AQI) for each
- Output: Visualization of trends using lineplots and measure statistical significances
